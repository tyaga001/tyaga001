## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm Ankur, a developer based in Sweden with ~15 years of experience. I specialize in connecting the dots between engineering, product marketing, growth strategies, community building, and developer education.

<summary>üîç More about my expertise</summary>

- üåê Developing, testing, and deploying web apps
- üßë‚Äçüè´ Coaching budding developers
- ‚úçÔ∏è Creating high-quality technical content
- üöÄ Product marketing and community outreach
- üõ†Ô∏è Exploring and reviewing developer tools

While I enjoyed being an engineer, my true passion lies in the entire process: coding, designing, developing, writing and then marketing about it.

From 2020 I've become increasingly interested in technical writing and have had multiple articles published on well known publications such as

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/TheAnkurTyagi/) 
- [DevTo](https://dev.to/tyaga001)
- [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/theankurtyagi)
