## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Ankur, a passionate technologist living in Sweden. With ~14 years of web experience, I bridge the gap between software engineering, product marketing, growth, community building, and developer education.

<details>
<summary>🔍 More about my expertise</summary>

- 🌐 Developing, testing, and deploying web apps
- 🧑‍🏫 Coaching budding developers
- ✍️ Creating high-quality technical content
- 🚀 Product marketing and community outreach
- 🛠️ Exploring and reviewing developer tools

While I enjoyed being an engineer, my true passion lies in the entire process: coding, designing, developing, writing and then marketing about it.

From 2020 I've become increasingly interested in technical writing and have had multiple articles published on well known publications such as

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/theankurtyagi/)
- [DevTo](https://dev.to/tyaga001)
- [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/theankurtyagi)
- [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@TheAnkurTyagi)
