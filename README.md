# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Ankur Tyagi

My Name is Ankur, living in Sweden and I'm passionate about new technology and developer tools, and I sit somewhere between software engineering, product marketing, growth, community building and developer advocacy. I've been involved with the web for ~14 years and the last 4 of which have been documented in punishing detail on my website.

## About Me

My expertise includes:
- Developing, testing, and deploying web applications
- Coaching budding developers
- Creating high-quality technical content
- Product marketing and community outreach

While I enjoyed being an Engineer, my true passion lies in the entire process: coding, designing, developing, and then writing about it.

## What I Do

- 💻 Develop and deploy web apps
- 🎓 Coach aspiring developers
- ✍️ Create top-notch technical content
- 🚀 Help tech products/SaaS reach developer communities
