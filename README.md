# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Ankur Tyagi

My Name is Ankur, living in Sweden and I'm passionate about new technology and developer tools, and I sit somewhere between software engineering, product marketing, growth, community building and developer advocacy. I've been involved with the web for ~14 years and the last 4 of which have been documented in punishing detail on my [website](https://theankurtyagi.com/).

## About Me

My expertise includes:
- Developing, testing, and deploying web applications
- Coaching budding developers
- Creating high-quality technical content
- Product marketing and community outreach

While I enjoyed being an engineer, my true passion lies in the entire process: coding, designing, developing, writing and then marketing about it.

From 2020 I've become increasingly interested in technical writing and have had multiple articles published on well known publications such as

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/theankurtyagi/)
- [DevTo](https://dev.to/tyaga001)
- [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/theankurtyagi)
- [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@TheAnkurTyagi)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Skills

- Full-Stack Development (React, Node.js, Next.js)
- Technical Writing & Documentation
